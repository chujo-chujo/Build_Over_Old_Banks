# Banks to supplement ECS vectors
**ECS Houses** has banks, water towers etc. coded as regular buildings and not industries, and therefore they get demolished by growing towns.
**“ECSext”** from Bananas replaces almost all of these buildings by industries (meaning they don’t disappear), but it doesn’t have a bank.

So, using graphics from OpenGFX I have made a simple newgrf that lets you build vanilla banks.
These accept gold or valuables (depending on your setting in ECS Town vector), just put it *after ECS vectors*.

It also has a parameter to generate banks at the start of a game:
